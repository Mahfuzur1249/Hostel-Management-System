# Hostel-Management-System
To address the challenges in managing hostel operations, we propose a Hostel Management System â€” a web-based (or desktop/mobile-based) application that digitally manages all hostel-related activities. This system will store and organize student information, room details, hostel capacity, and fee records in a centralized database.
